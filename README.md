# Power-BI-Retail-Customer-Retention-Analytics-TESCO-
This project aims to analyze customer retention performance at TESCO using Power BI. The analysis covers churn rate measurement, repeat purchase behavior, loyalty and promotion impact, store and regional performance, and customer lifetime value (CLV) segmentation.

## Churn and Retention Metrics
Churn refers to customers who have stopped purchasing within a defined time period. Measuring churn is critical because it directly impacts revenue stability and business growth.
The churn rate was calculated as:

Churn Rate = (Churned Customers ÷ Total Customers) × 100

The analysis examined churn across:
•	Region

•	Income Group

•	Store Type

•	Product Category

The findings revealed that churn is not uniformly distributed across segments. Certain regions and customer groups exhibit higher churn percentages, indicating localized performance gaps. Identifying these high-risk segments enables TESCO to implement targeted retention strategies rather than applying generalized solutions.
Retention rate, which represents the percentage of customers who continue purchasing, serves as the inverse of churn. High retention indicates strong customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Repeat Purchase Analysis
Repeat customers are those who make more than one purchase within a defined period. Repeat purchase behavior is a strong indicator of customer satisfaction and brand trust.

The analysis included:

•	Average purchase frequency by region and age group

•	Purchase frequency by loyalty tier

•	Identification of product categories most frequently bought by loyal customers

The results demonstrated that essential categories such as Grocery and Clothing drive stronger repeat behavior, while categories like Electronics show relatively lower repeat engagement.

Repeat customers contribute significantly to revenue stability and increased CLV. Therefore, strategies aimed at increasing repeat rate directly improve long-term profitability.

## Promotion and Loyalty Impact
This task evaluated the effectiveness of promotions and loyalty programs in influencing customer behavior.

The analysis included:

•	Percentage of transactions with promotion applied

•	Average purchase amount with and without promotion

•	Churn rate across loyalty tiers

•	Points earned versus points redeemed

The findings indicated that promotions positively influence short-term sales. However, over-dependence on promotions may reduce profit margins. Loyalty tiers demonstrated varying churn rates, suggesting that engagement levels differ across customer segments.

This analysis highlights the importance of personalized promotions and optimized reward structures rather than generic discounting strategies.

## Store Performance vs Retention

Store characteristics significantly influence customer retention outcomes. This task analyzed:

•	Average transaction amount by store type

•	Churn rate by region

•	Correlation between store opening year and retention

The results showed performance variations across regions and store formats. Some regions demonstrate strong revenue performance but also elevated churn rates, indicating potential service or competition challenges.

The opening year analysis suggests that store maturity may influence customer loyalty and stability. Older stores often exhibit more consistent retention patterns.
These insights support store-specific and region-specific campaign planning.

## Customer Value (CLV) Segmentation

Customers were segmented into three groups based on CLV distribution:

•	Low Value (Bottom 25%)

•	Medium Value (Middle 50%)

•	High Value (Top 25%)

Additionally, CLV was analyzed against Days Since Last Purchase to identify high-value customers at risk of churn.

This segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies:

•	Protect high-value customers

•	Re-engage at-risk customers

•	Manage low-value segments cost-effectively

Customer segmentation ensures that marketing investments generate maximum return.

## Final Dashboard– Multi-Page Reporting

The final Power BI report was structured into four pages:

#### Page 1: Overview KPIs

Provides summary metrics including churn rate, CLV, repeat rate, and revenue trends.

#### Page 2: Loyalty & Promotion Impact

Evaluates the effectiveness of reward programs and promotions on retention and spending behavior.

#### Page 3: Store & Region Insights

Analyzes performance variations across regions and store types to identify improvement areas.

#### Page 4: Customer Segmentation

Categorizes customers into churned, repeat, and high-value groups for targeted strategy development.

Interactive slicers were included for Region, Income Group, Loyalty Tier, and Store Type to enhance analytical flexibility.

## Strategic Recommendations
Based on the complete analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended:

1.	Strengthen loyalty program engagement to increase repeat purchases and reduce churn.

2.	Implement region-specific retention campaigns in high-churn areas.

3.	Protect and prioritize high-CLV customers through personalized benefits.

4.	Optimize promotion strategies to balance revenue growth and profitability.

5.	Improve service quality and product availability in underperforming stores.
